# GitHub Repository Helper
## Description

This Python module aims to achieve the following goals:

* Automate the process of creating GitHub template repositories. 
* Automate the creation of new repositories using the defined templates.
* Create template repositories with pre-defined pre-commit hooks, standardized GitHub actions that define a series of standard actions for linting, formatting, styling, and security checks.

## Design
### Core Functions
#### Initialization

This function should achieve the following objectives:

* It should define the following default paths for the application:

```bash
$/.gitrepohelper/config.cfg
$/git-repos
```
* The configuration file should have it's permissions set where it is only readable by the application itself. 

* The initialization function should also check if the ```gh``` cli tool is installed and query the host system locally for a GitHub authentication token. If the ```gh``` cli tool is not installed, the script should prompt for a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

    NOTE: This should also include a link to the GitHub documentation that describes how to create a PAT. Documentation link could be here, https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github

* Once the initialization function is run, some value or switch should be flipped so that the script does not re-run the initialization function.
